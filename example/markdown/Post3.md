# Welcome to Stog.js!

## What is Stog.js?

Stog.js is a utility for generating blogs as static webpages from markdown files!
What you are currently reading is a blog created using Stog (static-blog)!
Thanks to the power of markdown we can do some magic stuff, like including code blocks!

~~~
let title = 'Welcome';
let blog = 'Stog';
~~~

Anything you can do with markdown, you can do with Stog.
